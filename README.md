# EthicalShoping
A wiki style app that informs the consumer of the ethical concerns of a product


App initial pitch.

The goal is to give each individual greater control over what things they are 
supporting with their money and what things they can deliberately boycott. It is
 my firm personal believe capitalism is the best system for a fare and free society.
 Given this, I think that it functions best when the consumer can evaluate the
 products and services provided to them clearly and transparently, hopefully forcing
 the producer / manufacturer / sercice providor to pay closer attention to the will of
 the people.


The app intends to have three main components:
* The product lookup tool
* The group moderation of the wiki
* The incorporation of an EPR style food managent system


Product lookup:
My initial vision is to use barcodes, brands and titels to distinguish products and survives from one another.
 To direct the user to the 'wiki' page. I would like this to be easy to use and as simplistic as possible. 


Ethical wiki section:
This would ideally be a layout that would give people the rundown on the most important factors about the origin and effect of a particular product.
For example, where applicalble, things like:
+health concerns
+Use of ethical labour
+Environmental concerns
+political bias
+Ingredients
+Legal Terms of service agreements
+Growing regon
+Pollutants
+Privacy
+Security
+and so on...

This information would be filled in by users and wpuld be sorted or ranked by the interction of others users.
There are some places on the web that do a better at group moderation than others.
In my opinion examples that come to mind are, wikipedia.org and kialo.com. The second you may not have hear of but
It strikes me as tidey and structured. I would like to build of the concepts used buy these to make platforms voice the diverse moral stances
of individuals without infringing of there right to free speech. I find this particularly important in this current political landscape to male an
 effort to respect honer the sanctity and importance of people right to speech even when we disagree. If nothing else this is my goal.
